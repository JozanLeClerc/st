which sucks less. I've applied some patches.

To install this build, run these commands:

It is installed by default in the user /usr/local/bin directory but you can
change it to something that matches more your $PATH by editing the PREFIX
variable in config.mk.

You can find a list of patches and check what those I've applied are
doing on st's patches page.

Here is my list:

  - bold is not bright
  - clipboard
  - externalpipe

Most settings are done by editing config.h and recompiling.

 The default font is part of the Nerd Fonts collection but can
 be changed in config.h:19.
